            <h2>Rosalía de Castro</h2>
            <p>Rosalía de Castro was born in Santiago de Compostela on February 23, 1837.
                The date of 1836 that appears on her baptism <br>
                certificate is an error by the chaplain, since all the certificates that
                precede and follow are from the year 1837. In a document <br>
                signed before a notary public in 1843, Doña Teresa de Castro
                recognizes Rosalía as her natural daughter and gives the date of <br>
                birth as February 23, 1837. The document was with the papers from the wedding file
                of Murguía and Rosalía. Murguía had <br>
                requested exemption from fees, due to lack of financial resources, and the Church had filed it in the
                POOR section
                where no <br>
                one had thought to look for it. It was found there in 2021 by the
                researcher Sagrario Abelleira and the archivist Irene Galindo.</p>
