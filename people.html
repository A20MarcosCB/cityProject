            <h2>Rosalía de Castro</h2>
            <p>Rosalía de Castro was born in Santiago de Compostela on February 23, 1837.
                The date of 1836 that appears on her baptism certificate is an error by the
                chaplain, since all the certificates that precede and follow are from the year
                1837.
                In a document signed before a notary public in 1843, Doña Teresa de Castro
                recognizes Rosalía as her natural daughter and gives the date of birth as
                February 23, 1837. The document was with the papers from the wedding file
                of Murguía and Rosalía. Murguía had requested exemption from fees, due to
                lack of financial resources, and the Church had filed it in the POOR section
                where no one had thought to look for it. It was found there in 2021 by the
                researcher Sagrario Abelleira and the archivist Irene Galindo.</p>

            <h2>Camilo José Cela</h2>
            <p>Camilo José Cela Trulock. (Iria Flavia, A Coruña, May 11, 1916 - Madrid,
                January 17, 2002). Spanish writer and academic, winner of the Nobel Prize
                for Literature.
                In 1925 his family moved to Madrid. Before completing his high school studies,
                he fell ill and was interned in a sanatorium in Guadarrama (Madrid) during 1931
                and 1932, where he used forced rest in long reading sessions.</p>
