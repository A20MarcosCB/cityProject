        <h1>Main monuments of the city</h1>
        <p>Padrón is a small town of medieval origin that does not pass
            unnoticed within the Galician geography, and that offers
            a large <br>
            number of monuments in which to satisfy oneself with culture.</p>

            <p>
                It is a neoclassical style construction in which you can also see
                remains of previous temple uprisings. Inside you can find different <br>
                altars and walls with elements of the Jacobean tradition and of
                Santiago Apóstol.</p>

                decorated with an image of the Virgen del <br> Carmen, the work of the sculptor
                Gambino.</p>
